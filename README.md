# Team Profile Generator
In this project I created a Node.js command line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team an generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. My motivation behind building this project was to explore the use of testing using jest package in my application, as testing is key to making code maintainable. Another new area I explored in this project is the use of classes in their usage as templates to create new objects in JavaScript. 

## Technologies Used
* Jest package
* Inquirer package
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Node.js
* JSON
* Tailwind

## Criteria that I Met to Achieve this
* After a user is prompted for information about their team members a nicely formatted team roster HTML file is generated based on their input.
* When the user clicks on an  email in the HTML then the member's email address will populate the TO field in their default email program.
* When the user clicks on a github username in the HTML then they are taken to the relevant GitHub profile in a new tab.
* When the user starts the application they are prompted to enter the relevant information about the team manager: their name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
* Once information about the manager is entered they are prompted with a menu on whether they want to add: an engineer, an intern or if the team is complete.
* When the user selects the engineer option they are prompted for their: name, ID, email, and GitHub username. After that they are taken back to the menu.
* When the user selects the intern option they are prompted for their: name, ID, email, and school. After that they are taken back to the menu.
* When the user decided they have finished building their team then they exit the application, and the HTML is generated.

### Team Profile Generator 
I chose to display varying numbers of team members to show how how I utilised tailwind grids to give the layout of the cards polished.

### Default Answer
The default answer is the writing in brackets after the command line question. It can be selected by the user by just clicking enter.
